# BlocksLogin

The `BlocksLogin` is a customizable and user-friendly block designed to facilitate user authentication with email and
password. It provides an intuitive interface for a seamless login experience and includes a "Forgot Password" link,
enabling users to reset their password if needed. With the enable-sso parameter, the LoginBlock can be enhanced to
support Single Sign-On (SSO) with providers like Google or Apple, offering greater flexibility for integration. The
block is designed with accessibility and responsiveness in mind, ensuring it works well across devices and use cases.

npx @lenne.tech/cli blocks add BlockLogin
